However, from this data we can conclude that the temperature in Hawaii stays mild in both summer and winter. In order to further this analysis two additional queries that would be helpful are:
* Adding the precipitation statistics next to these temperature statistics. Although the weather may be mild year round, there is a rainy season in Hawaii. This could potentially impact consumer's desire for ice cream and may help make an informed decision about the infrastructure created around the shop. For example, including a covered patio so customers can sit out of the rain. 
* Additional analysis of temperature that is focused on year round trends and not just June and December could also provide additional insight. June and December were likely choose for this analysis because they are going to show the "extremes" in weather but having an understanding of if temperatures vary year round would also be helpful. The below graph sows a count of how many times a specific temperature occurred using all data in the set (range from 2010 -2017).
